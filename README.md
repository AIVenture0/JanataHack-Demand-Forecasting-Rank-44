## About
Demand Forecasting is the pivotal business process around which strategic and operational plans of a company are devised. Based on the Demand Forecast, strategic and long-range plans of a business like budgeting, financial planning, sales and marketing plans, capacity planning, risk assessment and mitigation plans are formulated.

## Problem Statement

One of the largest retail chains in the world wants to use their vast data source to __build an efficient forecasting model__ to predict the sales for each SKU in its portfolio at its __76 different stores__ using historical sales data for the __past 3 years__ on a week-on-week basis. Sales and promotional information is also available for each week - product and store wise. 

However, no other information regarding stores and products are available. Can you still forecast accurately the sales values for every such product/SKU-store combination for the __next 12 weeks accurately__?
